IN MY OPINION FAIRFAX PEOPLE ARE BEING OBLIGED TO PAY A PRICE FOR BEING FAIRFAX THAT, IN SOME CAST, COSTS MORE THAN THEY DESERVE TO PAY.
Also, I want to say that the plays and films were excellent, but there weren't enough of them for me.
In our Academy we are not allowed to smoke.
I was truly disappointed by it.
Secondly, I had to wait forty - five minutes before the show finally began.
I'd like you to send the money to this address: ul Taklowa 10
It is a dream becomes true and was really unexpected for me!
If not, what do you suggest?
The festival was evident in many ways, and in particular it being an international festival was a challenging, but brilliant idea.
